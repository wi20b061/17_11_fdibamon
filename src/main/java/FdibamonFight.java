    // - in each round, each fdibamon is a defender and an attacker at the same time, so the attack goes both ways (they both lose hp)
    //print function that shows the aftermath of the attack (i.e. the hitpoints of the fdibamons, their names and so on)
    // (?) seperate function for health check (hp can't be a value lower than 0)
    //function to determine the winner of the fight (the fdibamon that hits 0 hitpoints first is the loser, thus the other one is the winner)
    // - if both hit 0 in the same round - the fight is a draw
    // - print the result (maybe with the remaining hp as well?)
